ActivityPubBundle
=================

Compatible with Symfony 4.

**Work in progress, use with caution.**

For a working server using this bundle, see the [Reconnexion server](https://github.com/reconnexion/reconnexion-server).

> **Note**: This bundle currently uses MySQL and Doctrine for data storage.
We plan to use Apache Jena Fuseki's triple store instead.
